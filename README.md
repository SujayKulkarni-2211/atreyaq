# AtreyaQ: Quantum Drug Discovery Platform

## Overview

**AtreyaQ** is an open-source quantum-enhanced drug discovery platform. It brings together principles of **quantum chemistry**, **molecular simulations**, and **machine learning** into a unified, user-friendly interface that helps researchers, pharmaceutical scientists, and enthusiasts explore the potential of molecules in a highly efficient and intuitive way.

AtreyaQ leverages tools like **RDKit** for molecular modeling, and quantum computing frameworks (e.g., PennyLane) for energy simulations ‚Äî aiming to push the boundaries of early-stage drug discovery.

---

## Motivation

Traditional drug discovery is expensive, time-consuming, and computationally intensive. With the rise of quantum computing, new algorithms can simulate molecular behavior more precisely than classical counterparts. **AtreyaQ** provides a gateway to explore such capabilities while maintaining compatibility with classical computational chemistry methods.

## Chemistry Background

At its core, AtreyaQ is built on **molecular descriptors** and **quantum chemistry principles**:

### Molecular Descriptors:

These are numerical values that describe the properties of molecules, such as:

* Molecular weight
* Number of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors
* Topological polar surface area (TPSA)
* LogP (lipophilicity)
* Rotatable bonds, rings, and aromaticity

These descriptors feed into ML models or filtering processes during drug discovery.

### Quantum Chemistry:

Using **variational quantum eigensolvers (VQE)** and Hamiltonians (e.g., Pauli operators), we can estimate the ground-state energy of a molecule. Lower energy often correlates with higher stability and drug-likeness.

AtreyaQ will soon incorporate actual quantum hardware (or simulators) to perform these tasks.

## Quantum Computing Principles

### Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE):

A hybrid quantum-classical algorithm to solve for the smallest eigenvalue (i.e., ground state energy) of a molecule‚Äôs Hamiltonian. The quantum computer prepares parameterized quantum states, and a classical optimizer tunes them to minimize the expected energy.

### Qubit Mapping:

The molecule is encoded into a qubit Hamiltonian using transformations such as Jordan-Wigner or Bravyi-Kitaev. This allows quantum computers to simulate fermionic systems.

---

## Math Behind the Scenes

### Hamiltonian Construction:

For a given molecule:

```
H = c0*I + c1*Z0 + c2*Z1 + c3*Z0Z1 + ...
```

Where:

* `Z0`, `Z1` are Pauli-Z operators on different qubits
* `c0, c1...` are coefficients from molecular integrals

### Energy Estimation:

Energy is computed as:

```
E = <œà(Œ∏)| H | œà(Œ∏)>
```

Where `œà(Œ∏)` is a parameterized quantum state.

### Optimization:

Minimize `E(Œ∏)` using gradient descent or other optimizers. Classical computers update the parameters based on quantum outputs.
